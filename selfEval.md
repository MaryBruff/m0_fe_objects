# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

 *I think previously I was a little more nervous when I came across something I wasn't sure how to solve. I would feel more frantic and would get more overwhelmed. This time around I felt more comfortable not knowing what to do next. Instead of panic, I just approached the situation like “okay how can we figure this out” versus “Oh no! I don’t know how to do this!”*

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

 *The workflow has been pretty good thus far! Planning when I’d do my assignments has allowed me to get other distractions out of the way, and know from x time to y time my focus was on one thing. There have been a few times when I knew I needed a break or had to walk away. I have structured my time so that I can do those things and still get my work done.*

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

*I think something I want to remember is to try and look for similar problems from our lessons and work off of that. Trying to Google something or look through my notes often makes me more frustrated. Why this assignment felt more successful was because I tried to find a similar problem and work through it that way instead of trying to Google something.*
